You are analyzing a git diff to suggest different ways of grouping changes into logical commits.

# Task
Analyze the provided git diff and suggest THREE different "takes" (perspectives) on how to group these changes into logical commits. Each take should use a different organizational strategy.

# Input Files
{{range .Files -}}
- {{.}}
{{end}}

# Git Diff
```
{{.Diff}}
```

# Required Strategies
Please provide exactly 3 takes using these strategies:

1. **By Feature/Functionality** - Group changes by the features or capabilities they add/modify
2. **By Layer/Component** - Group changes by architectural layers (UI, business logic, data, tests, etc.)
3. **By Risk/Impact** - Group changes by their potential impact (safe refactors, risky changes, critical fixes, etc.)

# Output Format
Respond with ONLY valid JSON matching this exact structure (no additional commentary):

{
  "takes": [
    {
      "number": 1,
      "theme": "By Feature",
      "groups": [
        {
          "name": "Add user authentication",
          "rationale": "All changes related to implementing login/logout functionality",
          "files": ["auth.go", "login.html", "auth_test.go"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "number": 2,
      "theme": "By Layer",
      "groups": [
        {
          "name": "Backend logic",
          "rationale": "Core business logic changes",
          "files": ["auth.go", "user.go"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Frontend UI",
          "rationale": "User interface changes",
          "files": ["login.html", "style.css"]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "number": 3,
      "theme": "By Risk",
      "groups": [
        {
          "name": "Safe refactoring",
          "rationale": "Low-risk code cleanup with no behavior changes",
          "files": ["utils.go"]
        },
        {
          "name": "Critical security fix",
          "rationale": "Authentication vulnerability fix - needs careful review",
          "files": ["auth.go"]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

# Important Rules
- EVERY file from the input list MUST appear in exactly ONE group across all takes
- Each take should have 2-5 groups (not too granular, not too coarse)
- Group names should be concise and descriptive
- Rationales should explain WHY these files belong together
- Use the exact JSON structure shown above
- Do not include any text before or after the JSON
